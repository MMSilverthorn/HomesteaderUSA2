# HomesteaderUSA
Homesteading program to enable planning and documentation for the modern homesteader.

For the purposes of my Software Dev class project the goal is to finish completely the Animal section of a much larger program.
The program uses C# and SQL. Windows Forms is the UI. The project is for an independent Windows program for non techie users with out the need for the internet. This is a user friendly program.

Features are multiple tables and classes
Add Edit Delete to a Sql database
Hard coded SQL commands both simple and joined
UI interface (Windows Forms)
Splash screen
Login


This project is the reason I toook software developement.
